You can lock down on roles by creating your own wrapper dependency:

```python title="dependencies.py"
from fastapi import Depends
from fastapi_azure_auth.auth import InvalidAuth
from fastapi_azure_auth.user import User

async def validate_is_admin_user(user: User = Depends(azure_scheme)) -> None:
    """
    Validated that a user is in the `AdminUser` role in order to access the API.
    Raises a 401 authentication error if not.
    """
    if 'AdminUser' not in user.roles:
        raise InvalidAuth('User is not an AdminUser')
```

and then use this dependency over `azure_scheme`.
