Guest users and multi-tenant applications can be a bit confusing, but in short, any guest user you have in your tenant
can log into your application. In multi-tenant applications, the users will most likely log into the application through their own tenant,
but it is possible for the user to force-login as a guest in another tenant (if it has a guest user).

You can block guest users from logging in by reading the [Guest Users](../single-tenant/guest_users.mdx) documentation.
