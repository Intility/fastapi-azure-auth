**FastAPI-Azure-Auth** implements Azure AD authentication and authorization for your FastAPI APIs and OpenAPI
documentation.

In the sidebar to the left you'll be able to find information on how to configure both Azure and your FastAPI application.
If you need an example project, one can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Intility/fastapi-azure-auth/tree/main/demo_project).

The first step is to decide whether your application should be single- or multi-tenant. You can always change this later,
so if you're unsure, you should chose **single-tenant**.

Even though FastAPI-Azure-Auth supports both `v1` and `v2` tokens,
if you're creating a new project, you should use `v2` tokens. We'll walk you through all the steps in this tutorial.
If you have a project up and running already, and want to change from `v1` to `v2`, you can do so in the [manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#v10-and-v20). To read about the difference between `v1` and `v2` tokens, check out
[this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens).
