title: Calling your APIs from Python
sidebar_position: 4
---

In order to call your APIs from Python (or any other backend), you should use the [Client Credential Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow).

1. Navigate to [Azure -> Azure Active Directory -> App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps)
and find your **OpenAPI application registration***
2. Navigate over to `Certificate & secrets`
3. Click `New client secret`
4. Give it a name and an expiry time
5. Click `Add`

:::info
*In this example, we used the already created OpenAPI app registration in order to keep it short,
but in reality you should create a new app registration for _every_ application talking to your backend.
In other words, if someone wants to use your API, they should create their own app registration and their own secret.

:::info
You can use client certificates too, but we won't cover this here.

6. Copy the secret and save it for later.

7. Fetch the token from Azure, and then call your own API endpoint:

```python title="my_script.py"
from httpx import AsyncClient
from demo_project.core.config import settings

async with AsyncClient() as client:
    azure_response = await client.post(
        url=f'https://login.microsoftonline.com/{settings.TENANT_ID}/oauth2/v2.0/token',
        data={
            'grant_type': 'client_credentials',
            'client_id': settings.OPENAPI_CLIENT_ID,  # the ID of the app reg you created the secret for
            'client_secret': settings.CLIENT_SECRET,  # the secret you created
            'scope': f'api://{settings.APP_CLIENT_ID}/.default',  # note: NOT .user_impersonation
        }
    )
    token = azure_response.json()['access_token']

    my_api_response = await client.get(
        'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/hello-graph',
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'},
    )
    print(my_api_response.json())
```

:::info
If you install `ipython`  you can use `asyncio` code directly in your terminal.
(`poetry add ipython --dev`)
