By default, guest users in your tenant will be able to access your APIs. You can block this in code by checking
the users `tid` is equal to yours, or preferably by configuring Azure AD. If you're using Azure AD, the user
will be denied to sign in, instead of getting a 403 when he's fetches his token.

Go to **all** your [Enterprise Applications](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AllApps/menuId/)
and do the following steps. You can find your Enterprise Application either by searching on the Client ID in the
[Enterprise Applications](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AllApps/menuId/) menu,
or by first navigating to your [App registration](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) and
clicking the `Managed application in local directory` link:

Under **Properties**, enable `User assignment required?` and **Save**.

Then, go to **Users and groups**, and **add user/group**. Find users or a fitting group and assign it to the role Default Access.

:::note
Groups you select should have all users as direct members of the group. Nested groups does not work with Enterprise Applications.
