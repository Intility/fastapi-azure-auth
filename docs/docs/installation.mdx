You can install FastAPI-Azure-Auth like any other package on PyPI:

```shell
pip install fastapi-azure-auth
# OR
poetry add fastapi-azure-auth
```

:::info
At the moment Python 3.9+ is only supported. If you can't install the package, check your Python version.
:::

We'll configure the package in [FastAPI Configuration](fastapi_configuration.mdx),
but first we need an application in Azure AD. If you already have this completed, you can skip the next page.
